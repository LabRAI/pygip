Overview
--------

PyHazards brings together public dataset catalogs, registry-based models,
benchmark families, experiment configs, and shared training or reporting
workflows across wildfire, earthquake, flood, and tropical cyclone tasks.

It is designed for researchers and practitioners who need one coherent library
for reproducing baselines, comparing methods, and extending hazard-ML
workflows without rebuilding the software stack for each hazard family.

Why PyHazards
-------------

.. grid:: 1 1 2 4
   :gutter: 2
   :class-container: catalog-grid home-pillar-grid

   .. grid-item-card:: Unified Datasets
      :class-card: catalog-detail-card

      Public datasets, forcing sources, and inspection surfaces are documented through one hazard-first catalog.

   .. grid-item-card:: Benchmark-aligned Evaluation
      :class-card: catalog-detail-card

      Shared benchmark families, smoke configs, and report exports make model comparisons more reproducible.

   .. grid-item-card:: Registry-based Models
      :class-card: catalog-detail-card

      Baselines and adapters are exposed through a consistent build surface instead of one-off scripts.

   .. grid-item-card:: Shared Training and Inference
      :class-card: catalog-detail-card

      One engine layer supports training, evaluation, prediction, and benchmark execution across hazard tasks.

Featured Example
----------------

.. container:: home-section-note

   Run a benchmark-aligned smoke configuration with one command, then move into the full Quick Start for model building and training workflows.

.. code-block:: bash

   python scripts/run_benchmark.py --config pyhazards/configs/flood/hydrographnet_smoke.yaml

.. container:: catalog-link-row

   **Next step:** :doc:`Quick Start <quick_start>` for the first full workflow, or :doc:`Models <pyhazards_models>` to browse benchmark-linked baselines.

For Contributors
----------------

PyHazards is registry-driven and uses dataset cards, model cards, and benchmark
cards to generate the public catalogs. If you plan to extend the library, use
:doc:`implementation` for the contributor workflow and :doc:`appendix_a_coverage`
for the audited gap list behind the current roadmap work.
