## Overview

PyHazards is built for hazard-AI work that needs more than a single model or
paper reproduction. It unifies dataset discovery, model construction,
benchmark-aligned evaluation, and experiment plumbing so the same library can
support first-run baselines, comparative studies, and contributor extensions.

Intended users:

- **Researchers**: run benchmark-aligned experiments and compare baselines across hazard tasks.
- **Practitioners**: reuse hazard-specific workflows for data inspection, model building, and evaluation.
- **Contributors**: extend datasets, models, and benchmarks through registry and catalog patterns already used in the repo.

## Why PyHazards

- **Unified datasets**: public hazard datasets, forcing sources, and inspection entrypoints live in one curated catalog.
- **Benchmark-aligned evaluation**: shared benchmark families, smoke configs, and reports keep experiments comparable.
- **Registry-based models**: published baselines and adapters are built through a consistent model-registry surface.
- **Shared training and inference pipelines**: one engine layer supports fit, evaluate, predict, and benchmark execution workflows.

## Hazard Coverage

- **Wildfire**: danger forecasting, weekly forecasting, spread baselines, fuels, burn products, and active-fire sources.
- **Earthquake**: waveform picking, dense-grid forecasting adapters, and linked benchmark ecosystems for picking and forecasting.
- **Flood**: streamflow and inundation baselines with benchmark-backed evaluation paths.
- **Tropical Cyclone**: track-and-intensity forecasting baselines plus shared benchmark ecosystems and adapters.

## Installation

Install PyHazards from PyPI:

```bash
pip install pyhazards
```

If you need GPU execution, install a compatible PyTorch build first and then
select the device as needed:

```bash
export PYHAZARDS_DEVICE=cuda:0
```

## Quick Start

Use this as the shortest benchmark-aware starter path: verify the package,
build one registered model, and run one smoke benchmark config.

1. Verify the installation:

```bash
python -c "import pyhazards; print(pyhazards.__version__)"
```

2. Build a registered model:

```python
from pyhazards.models import build_model

model = build_model(
    name="hydrographnet",
    task="regression",
    node_in_dim=2,
    edge_in_dim=3,
    out_dim=1,
)
print(type(model).__name__)
```

3. Run a benchmark-aligned smoke configuration:

```bash
python scripts/run_benchmark.py --config pyhazards/configs/flood/hydrographnet_smoke.yaml
```

4. Continue with the full docs for dataset inspection, benchmark pages, and
training workflows.

## Project Structure

- `pyhazards.datasets` - dataset catalog, registry surfaces, and inspection entrypoints.
- `pyhazards.models` - model registry, builders, and reusable baseline implementations.
- `pyhazards.benchmarks` - benchmark families, ecosystem mappings, and evaluation contracts.
- `pyhazards.engine` - shared training, inference, runner, and experiment utilities.
- `pyhazards.configs` - smoke and example benchmark configurations.
- `docs/` and `docs/source/` - published documentation, generated catalogs, and contributor guides.

## Supported Workflows

- inspect hazard datasets and forcing sources before training,
- build baseline and adapter models through the unified registry,
- run smoke tests and benchmark configs for hazard-specific tasks,
- export benchmark reports and compare metrics across models,
- extend the library with new datasets, models, benchmarks, and catalog entries.
